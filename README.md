## What is SERAPH?
SERAPH gives users the power to keep their immediate community safe with a social networking platform focused on covering accidents, incidents, and other hazards as they report it. With SERAPH, every user is a member of their community with the responsibility of keeping everyone alert and informed.

### Post-script
SERAPH was made as a term project in February 2023. Initially, I've included text verification and notifications. Because of the limitations of the Twilio platform for free accounts, this feature has been disabled (Users will not be able to add phone numbers, nor receive messages).
